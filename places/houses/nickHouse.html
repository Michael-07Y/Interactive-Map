                    <p>In Baz Luhrmann's 2013 adaptation of "The Great Gatsby," Nick Carraway's modest cottage serves as a contrast to the extravagant mansions of his wealthy neighbors. Tucked away in the less ostentatious enclave of West Egg, Nick's humble abode reflects his character's down-to-earth nature and moral integrity. The cottage is characterized by its simplicity and charm, with a cozy atmosphere that stands in stark contrast to the lavish excesses of the Jazz Age. It serves as a sanctuary for Nick amidst the chaos of high society, offering him solace and a sense of groundedness as he navigates the complexities of love, loyalty, and disillusionment in the glittering world of the 1920s.</p>
