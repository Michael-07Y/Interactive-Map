                <div class="description">
                    <p>In Baz Luhrmann's 2013 adaptation of "The Great Gatsby," the Buchanan mansion stands as a symbol of wealth, opulence, and the excesses of the Jazz Age. Set amidst the affluent enclave of East Egg, the mansion exudes an aura of grandeur with its sprawling estate, manicured lawns, and lavish interiors. Characterized by its ornate architecture, towering columns, and luxurious d√©cor, the Buchanan mansion serves as the prestigious residence of Tom and Daisy Buchanan. It becomes a central setting where the characters' lives intertwine, reflecting the superficiality and moral decay that underlie the facade of glamour and privilege in the world of the novel.</p>
