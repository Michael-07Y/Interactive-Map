                    <p>In Baz Luhrmann's 2013 adaptation of "The Great Gatsby," George Wilson's garage stands as a stark contrast to the opulence and grandeur of the mansions in East and West Egg. Located in the desolate and industrial landscape of the Valley of Ashes, George's garage is a symbol of the forgotten and marginalized working class. The garage itself is dilapidated, with worn-out machinery and a grimy interior that reflects the harsh realities of poverty and decay. It serves as George's place of work and residence, a stark reminder of his humble existence and the struggles he faces to make ends meet.</p>
