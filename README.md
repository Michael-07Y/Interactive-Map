## Map Refrence With Commonly Asked Questions

![Map](/images/map.png)

### What is this for?

> This project was made to display information about the locations and people in *The Great Gatsby* film from 2013. The map contains spots of the West and East egg location, the Valley of Ashes, and the mansions/houses that were in the film

### Why would you use an interactive map instead of just drawing one?

> An interactive map gives a better use of refrence when people/users are wanting to find information.  This map gives a clear purpose to fit all of those actions by allowing users to select what they want to see and also a short description about the location/person. 

### Have you learned anything from this project?

> Considering the amount of hours put into this project that being in school and out of school was all needed for my outcome.  I have learned both programming skills and general information about the film itself.
